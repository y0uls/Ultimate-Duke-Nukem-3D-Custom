            "Description": "Original description: Pursuing ancient legends and myths, Duke has traveled deep into the Amazon jungle on a mission to discover the existence of a long lost and half buried Aztec city. What Duke discovers there could alter mankind's perception of ancient history forever. But can our hero survive the perils of such a dangerous quest, and still uncover the terrible secret behind AZTEC?

I'm sure if you have played through all of Duke it out in DC and found the secret level then you would be familiar with this map. The mapper was brought onto the addon and included a piece of this level. He also went on to work on Manhattan Project.

I claim to own nothing about this map and if Robert Travis wants the map down then, he can contact in some way I guess, I did try his email but that was long dead.

If you make a video of any of the user maps I have uploaded, simply put it into the comments and I'll add it to the corresponding workshop page as I kind of want to have up to two videos on each item :)",
