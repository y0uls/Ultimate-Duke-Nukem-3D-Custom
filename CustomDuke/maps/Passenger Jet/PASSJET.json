            "Description": "Original description: Seems like the aliens have hijacked a passenger jet. Basically Duke must clear the aircraft of all aliens. It is suspected that power on the aircraft has been paritally destroyed, therefore duke must activate backup power and make his way to the cockpit to hit. The following map was apart of the Duke is 007 TC until it fell through
early 1999. Several maps have been released to show the people what they were expecting to see.
