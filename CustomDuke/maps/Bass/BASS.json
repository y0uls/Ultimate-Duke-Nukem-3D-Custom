	"Description": " I built this map back in August 1999, and it was the last Duke Nukem 3d level I ever made. It features an impressive abyss, a hangar, some sort of subway, a canteen, storage rooms, server rooms, many enemies, a dozen secrets, vents, explosions (actually, too many in its first versions), in-room aquariums that you can enter, a boss fight, etc. pp.
	                 In my humble opinion: it is quite a nice single player level, even today. :)",
