	"Description": "This is a little something I made a while back. I really didn't intend to upload it to the Workshop. It was pretty much just a work of art, but now it's playable. I'm not sure how it will play. It will probably be an awkward Dukematch experience, but it is what it is. I hope you enjoy!",
