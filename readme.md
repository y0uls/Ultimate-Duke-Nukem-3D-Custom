# Using Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom

To use it, simply **run** the "**Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom.exe**" and choose the launch options!

Have fun for many hours!

_It is possible to add a custom map for example by running "**Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom.exe**", choose "**Maps**" from the drop-down list then click on "**Browse Folder**"._

_Once in the "maps" folder, create a folder with the name of the map and place the .map file there._

**!! Be careful in the "maps" section, the folders must contain only 1 .map file !!**\
**If there are several maps files, do the same manipulation but in the "mods" section**
