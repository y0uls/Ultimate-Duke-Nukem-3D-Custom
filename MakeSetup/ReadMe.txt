A huge thank you to all the contributors, map creator, community, mod developer and so on, for allowing me the creation of this launcher, bringing together all the best custom maps from this iconic game, Duke Nukem 3D!

To use it, simply run the "Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom.exe" and choose the launch options!
Have fun for many hours!

It is possible to add a custom map for example by running "Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom.exe", choose "Choose a custom map" from the drop-down list then click on "Browse". 
Once in the "maps" folder, create a folder with the name of the map and place the .map file there. 

!! Be careful in the "maps" section, the folders must contain only 1 .map file !!
If there are several maps files, do the same manipulation but in the "mods" section
